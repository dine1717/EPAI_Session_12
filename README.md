# EPAI3_Session12 - Iterables and Iterators -2

Goal 1:

Refactor the `Polygon` class so that all the calculated properties are lazy properties, i.e. they should still be calculated properties, but they should not have to get recalculated more than once (since we made our `Polygon` class "immutable").
 

Goal 2:


Refactor the `Polygons` (sequence) type, into an **iterable**. Make sure also that the elements in the iterator are computed lazily - i.e. you can no longer use a list as an underlying storage mechanism for your polygons.
